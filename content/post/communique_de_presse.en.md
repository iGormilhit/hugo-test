RERO: the work on the future competence centre has begun!

On September 13, 2018, the CIIP, RERO's regulatory authority, gave the go-ahead for the launch of the future centre of competence and services for libraries - the "RERO 21" project. A private law and public interest foundation will be created in 2019, and will gradually replace the current RERO until 2021.

The foundation will provide interested cantonal, municipal, heritage, legal and school libraries with a new collaborative open source library management system. The future SONAR (Swiss Open Access Repository) is also part of the range of services of the future competence centre, which has been established partly in the continuity of RERO's current services.

The new open source library management system, which is being developed at the RERO power plant in collaboration with CERN, is based on the Invenio 3 technology platform and will be operational by the end of 2020. [RERO-ILS](https://ils.test.rero.ch)  

These developments will be presented in March 2019 on the next RERO Day. An invitation will follow shortly.
