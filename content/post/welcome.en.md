Welcome to the RERO21 blog!

The team at the RERO Central Office in Martigny welcomes you to its blog dedicated to the RERO21 project aimed at transforming RERO's current structure into a future competence and service centre for libraries by 2021.

This blog has been designed as a showcase for the project and an effective way to establish communication around it with all interested partners in a transparent way.
Here you will find all the useful information about the project (see the pages "Presentations" and "Links and useful information").
Blog posts will be posted regularly to report on the progress of the project and the various themes it addresses, including the new ILS "RERO-ILS" currently under development
to the RERO Central Office, which certainly represents the main aspect, as well as on the multilingual entity file (MEF), SONAR, and others.

The blog will naturally evolve over time according to the outlines drawn by the project.

Feel free to contact us through the different channels available in the "Contact" section.
This same section allows you to subscribe to the blog's RSS feed to be kept informed of all the latest news.

We look forward to continuing this exciting and engaging project and to benefiting from your contributions.

Enjoy your reading.

The RERO Central Team
